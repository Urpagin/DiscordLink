## 🏃‍♂️ Getting Started

DiscordLink is built on top of Spigot and is compatible with PaperMC onwards. Currently, it is only available for Minecraft version 1.21.

### Installation Steps

1. Download the `.jar` release file and place it in the `plugins` directory on your server.
2. Launch the server once to generate the config file at `./plugins/DiscordLink/config.yml`.
3. Populate the `config.yml` with your Discord bot token and a channel ID.
4. Restart the server.
5. Enjoy!

## 🛠️ Additional Information

The plugin interacts with Discord through the [JDA](https://github.com/discord-jda/JDA) library.
