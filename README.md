# DiscordLink

DiscordLink provides an interface between the Chat of a Minecraft server and a Discord Channel.

Here is a demo:




## 🏃‍♂️ Getting Started

DiscordLink is a plugin build on top of Spigot, so compatible with PaperMC onwards. It is, for now, only available in 1.21.


1. Download the .jar release file and place it under the `plugins` directory on your server.
2. Launch the server once to generate the config file under `./plugins/DiscordLink/config.yml`
3. Stop the server
4. Populate the `config.yml` with your Discord bot token and a channel ID
5. Start the server
6. Have fun!

## 🛠️ Additional Info

The plugin interacts with Discord using [JDA](<https://github.com/discord-jda/JDA>) library.
