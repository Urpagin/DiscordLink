# SyncChat

🚰 [Also available on SpigotMC.](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/syncchat-discord-link.121376/)

SyncChat provides an interface between the chat functionality of a Minecraft server and a Discord channel.

**Everything is configurable** through the `plugin.yml` file. Nearly all text sent to either Minecraft or Discord can be tweaked in the config.

Here is an (old) demo (no slash-commands):
